At Meanwhile, user safety and well-being are our top priorities. The app is designed exclusively for users aged 18 and older. We have implemented robust measures to encourage compliance, moderate content, and address inappropriate behavior effectively.

1. Age Restrictions
Access Policy: Meanwhile is intended for users aged 18 and older.
Age Confirmation: During onboarding, users must confirm they are 18 or older.
Limitations: While we take steps to restrict access by minors, we rely on users to provide truthful information about their age. Misrepresentation of age is a violation of our terms of use.
2. Content Moderation
In-App Content:
Public sharing of explicit material, nudity, or graphic violence is strictly prohibited.
Uploaded profile photos are visible only to authenticated users within the app.
Automated Moderation:
Real-time moderation is applied to chat messages in both chat and party screens, using OpenAI tools to detect and block inappropriate content.
Photos uploaded by users are moderated automatically before they are accepted.
Flagged Content Handling: Content flagged as inappropriate is logged for review and may lead to further action, including account suspension.
3. Reporting and Blocking Features
User Reporting:
In-app reporting allows users to report inappropriate content or behavior easily. Reports can be made regarding explicit content, harassment, or suspected abuse.
Blocking Mechanism:
Users can block others to prevent interaction and maintain a safe experience.
Action on Reports:
Critical reports (e.g., child abuse) automatically trigger alerts to app administrators.
Reports are reviewed promptly to assess and address any violations of community guidelines.
4. Data Privacy
Data Encryption: All user data is encrypted in transit and securely stored.
Privacy Safeguards: Sensitive information is neither shared with third parties without explicit user consent nor used for purposes outside the app's functionality.
5. Prohibited Conduct
The following activities are strictly prohibited on Meanwhile:

Misrepresentation of age or identity.
Harassment, exploitation, or inappropriate behavior.
Sharing explicit or offensive content, including nudity, sexual material, or graphic violence.
Attempts to contact or groom minors (despite the app's 18+ design).
6. Cooperation with Authorities
Compliance: Meanwhile complies with all applicable laws regarding child safety and abuse prevention.
Reporting: Any user-generated content flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is reviewed and, if verified, reported promptly to the appropriate authorities.
