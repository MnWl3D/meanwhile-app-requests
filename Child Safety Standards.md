Child Safety Standards for Meanwhile App

At Meanwhile, we prioritize user safety and well-being. While our app is designed exclusively for users aged 18 and older, we have implemented mechanisms to encourage compliance and provide tools for reporting and addressing inappropriate behavior.

1. Age Restrictions
Access Policy: Meanwhile is intended for users aged 18 and older.
Age Confirmation: During the onboarding process, users are required to confirm that they are 18 years or older.
Limitations: While we take steps to restrict access to minors, we rely on users to provide truthful information regarding their age.
2. Content Moderation
In-App Content:
Meanwhile does not allow public sharing of user-generated content that includes explicit material, nudity, or graphic violence.
Uploaded profile photos are visible only to other authenticated users within the app.
Moderation: Content monitoring and moderation are currently manual and limited during testing. Future updates will include automated tools for enhanced moderation.
3. Reporting and Blocking Features
User Reporting: Users can report inappropriate content or behavior directly within the app using the in-app reporting feature.
Blocking Mechanism: Users can block others to prevent further interaction and maintain a safe experience.
Action on Reports: Reports are reviewed promptly to assess and address violations of community guidelines.
4. Data Privacy
User data is encrypted in transit and stored securely.
Sensitive information is neither shared with third parties without user consent nor used for purposes outside the app's core functionality.
